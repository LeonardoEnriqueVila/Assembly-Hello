# Assembly Experiments

This repository contains a series of experiments with Assembly language. It includes a simple "Hello, World!" executable as well as various `.asm` files with different experimental codes I created to introduce myself to Assembly programming.

## Description

The purpose of this repository is to document my journey and experiments with Assembly language. This is a learning project where I explored various aspects of Assembly programming through hands-on practice. The repository includes:

- A simple "Hello, World!" program written in Assembly and compiled into an executable.
- Several `.asm` files containing different experimental Assembly code snippets.

## Notes

- These Assembly programs are written for the x86_64 architecture.
- The code examples are basic and primarily for educational purposes, demonstrating fundamental Assembly programming concepts.
- To run the Assembly programs, you will need an assembler like NASM (Netwide Assembler) and a linker like LD (GNU Linker).
